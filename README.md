# Career Mate aims to bring more educational value to Facebook-time of teenagers. 

## The story
- I'll talk about that in the presentation :)

## Main features:
- Ask for the teenagers' interested careers and skills needed
- Suggest succesful people and groups on those careers and skills so the teenagers can follow and have a 'better' Newsfeed
- And most amazingly, it acts as a personal trainers to push the teenagers to improve their skills daily by short courses delivered by both the mobile app and directly on Facebook Messenger

## Technology used
- Android
- Node JS
- Messenger Platform
- Firebase

## Prototype limitation
- Due to limited time, the Android client is not yet full featured, have a little "childish" design, and the data is not fully synchronized between mobile apps and the messenger bot
- However thanks to sharing the same Firebase data structure, we'll certainly build a better and unified experience across platforms
- Also due to limited time, we can only prepare short sample data for 2 courses (English for Beginners and Intermediate English)
- The code are a pretty messy (Thanks Code Collapsing for saving our souls!) and are definitely not Production ready. (I don't expect to write Production ready code on Node JS and Firebase after just 1 day of learning them prior to this Hackathon, no.)

## How to test
- Sign in to Facebook with account 'hoangthiendi.0502@gmail.com'. (Contact us for the password). Your own account won't work due to Facebook restrictions to unpublished app.
- Say Hi to "https://www.messenger.com/t/661794463969839" and choose one of the English course to test the experience
- Android APK is available on github as well - make sure to use the same Facebook account above
